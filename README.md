## Inspiration
_Working on the betterment of healthcare by creating an Elderly Assistance application._ This line itself gives me the motivation to work on MedGuard to help elder people stay healthy. Many of the features in the application are inspired from the products that already exists in the market. For example, MedGuard's homepage generates contains a personalized blog post for the user. By personalize, I mean that the blog post is related to the symptoms and disease the user has provided to the application. I got this idea while I opened Google on my mobile and saw a few posts/news on their homepage. Those posts really interested me and helped me in my day to day life. I have come across many such good experiences while using technology, and I have tried to inspire from all of them while creating this application. After all the user experience should be really good if it is an assistance application(Especially when its Elderly Assistance).

## What it does
MedGuard is an elderly assistance mobile application and helps its users to stay healthy. 
While building the application, many aspects have been taken into consideration. For the same reason, there are a lot of accessibility features that will improve the user experience for an elder.

**Accessibility features include:-**
- Text to speech: User can long press any text in the application to hear it.
- Speech to text: User can use the mic button to speak and convert the speech to text. At the same time, we also give an option for user to speak about the issues they face. Using Artificial Intelligence, we detect symptoms that the user might have. Later the data is used to find out what disease the user might have.
- Clean design: We have used a very simple design which is really easy to understand and navigate.
- Theme: While decided the application's theme, we made sure that the elder people likes it. 

**Features include:-**
- **Medication Reminders:** Medguard helps its users to set medication reminders and notify users when its time to take a medicine.
- **Disease Detector:** Medguard alerts the user if they have any disease depending on the symptoms that they provided. Medguard also provides the chance of user having that disease and if they should show to a doctor.
- **Personalized Tips:** Medguard uses the symptoms and diseases the user has to provide personalized blog post to the user. The post contains tips to stay healthy, recommended diet's recipe, how to prevent a disease, and a lot more.
- **Appointment Schedule:** Medguard allows its users to book an appointment with a doctor depending on the doctor's timetable. Doctors can also check the symptoms and disease that a patient has.

## How we built it
After the ideation part, the first step to start the process was to design the mobile application. I am not good at designing so I picked up an already existing template and worked upon it. Figma software was used to design the application's prototype. Flutter framework and the Dart programming language has been used to build the mobile application. Flutter is an open source framework that allows developers to create cross platform applications. 
## Challenges we ran into
I joined the hackathon 2 days after it started and had really less time. At the same time, I had half of my day invested in my school. It gets even worse when its a solo project and its just me who is working. Time management was the main issue throughout the hackathon.
I am not good at designing so it was a big task for me to search for a good template and edit it according to my application.
At last, it sometimes got really difficult to program a few features in the working prototype. Though I managed to complete the prototype but there were a few instances where it took me whole day to fix a few errors.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I could complete the project even with a lot of time constraints. I was working solo and I had done all the work from making design, to development, to presentation. Though, I am glad that I could complete the project. At the same time I learned a lot of new things for example using Google Gemini's API to integrate AI in MedGuard.

## What we learned
I learned a lot of things while working on this project which includes technical skills, life skills, communication skills, etc. It was my first time integrating artificial intelligence in a software application. I learned how to create functionalities using Google's Gemini. I also got to know how to manage time and handle pressure situations. 

## What's next for MedGuard
- Voice memo for doctors, with AI to update data
- An application for doctors: An application where doctors can register and list themselves on Medguard. Users can book an appointment with a doctor for a checkup or meeting.
- Virtual meeting with doctor: An option for users and doctors to have a video call in the application itself.
- Call a nurse: Users can hire a nurse to help them with their work/medications.
- Smart bands: Smart bands will track user's health's data in real time and check for any abnormalities.
